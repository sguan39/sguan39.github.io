                    <p>
                        I am currently a graduate student getting a Masters in Information Experience Design. Before this, 
                        I lived and taught English in South Korea for six years. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Growing up, I played puzzle games on my Nintendo DS, specifically both the 
                        Professor Layton series and the Ace Attorney series. With Professor Layton, I enjoyed the variety
                        of logic puzzles, and with Ace Attorney, I loved using evidence to make connections and to deduce whodunnit.
                        So, it was no surprise that I recruited three friends to do my first escape room on June 19, 2016. 
                        It was a room called "The Rec Room" by Escape the Room NYC and was a terrible experience!! 
                        There was no story, the game master was useless, the puzzles were easy and, on top of that, 
                        we had to share our booking with a group of teenagers celebrating a birthday! 
                        (Since then, the location and room no longer exist, phew!) But that didn't stop me from
                        trying another room...and another...and another abroad..Needless to say, when I travel, the first thing
                        I look up is "escape rooms nearby."
                    <p>
                    <p>In all honesty, I made this website for one of my classes to showcase my understanding in basic
                        HTML and CSS. But, I often get asked about my escape room adventures and if there are any I 
                        recommend, so here's a great way to help those who are interested!
                    </p>
