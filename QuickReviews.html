           These opinions are my own and based on my own preferences, so keep in mind

            <p> My second room with this company! The set design was amazing, but I felt the puzzles could have been better balanced in difficulty. Sometimes the puzzles were either too easy, or too hard (and sometimes time-wasters). But other than that, really interactive and fun!</p>

            <p> The room was super cute, fit the Scooby Doo style, and included voice acting from the characters! 
               The puzzles were OK and approachable, but overall, the room was pretty worn-down and 
               some of the tech was not working properly, which happened so much that it affected how I felt about the room overall.

            <p> This room is the best in all of Boston for a reason. The design of everything from the delivery of the story,
               the puzzles, and the room was amazing. We found ourself stuck sometimes, but never frustrated. Genuinely have never been to a room like this, and I am so glad I did it! Highly highly recommend if you're in Boston!!

            <p>This was a spontaneous choice, but ironically the room's theme was NYC's subway system. It don't think
           they anticipated a native New Yorker to come with the MTA map memorized, but it was really fun! I enjoyed
           the use of tech here and didn't find the puzzles to be overwhelmingly difficult. I think this would be
           a great starter room for newbies!</p>

            <p> An interesting take on how a dystopian future could look (especially with machines and AI) this room
               had a lot of puzzles that creatively used the physical space of the room. I really enjoyed the theme 
               even though we had a few technical hiccups.

            <p>Overall, this room felt OK, nothing unique or standout about it. I felt there were a lot of
           time-wasting puzzles that did not involve using logic. The story was basic and the mechanics of everything
           weren't anything unique. I almost felt bad this was my friends' first experience when better rooms exist.</p>

            <p> You can choose your level of difficulty 
               (and obviously we picked the most difficult one). We had a few puzzles that stumped us, but
               it does not deter how I feel about the room. Everything was designed with intention, and the story was 
               unexpected! Thoroughly enjoyed the use of tech and props in this room.</p>
